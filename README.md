# Fullstack CRUD Application - Backend
 
### About The Project
&nbsp;  
The goal of this project is to showcase proper use of the MVC (Model View Controller) architectural pattern, as well as the four basic CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete. 

In this implementation I have created a bookstore where the user can add any books they would like to buy or sell into a database. In order for the user to add a new book to the database they will need to fill out the following:

- Book title
- Author name
- Description of the book
- Price
- Cover image

Once listed the books can be updated and deleted.
